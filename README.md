The code in this repo is for recreating the results for the paper "Conditionally Parameterized, Discretization-Aware Neural Networks for Mesh-Based Modeling of Physical Systems".

The code is tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with Python 3.8. The conda environment is exported to env.yml.

Additional tools required include Matlab for the pre- and post-processing of the super-resolution case, and tecplot for pre- and post-processing of the reacting flow simulation case.

Separate README files are provided in the folder for each case
